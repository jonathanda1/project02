RR : RESTAURANT REVIEW

A website dedicated to providing valuable information for hungry users to see if the restaurant they had in mind was where they really wanted to go. Here you can view a brief description of the restaurant along with details such as the address and type of cuisine. Along with viewing restaurant information, a user can also leave comments informing future users of anything they might want to know.
